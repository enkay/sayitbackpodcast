V: what do you mean
L: Every week we'll have a different bachelor or bachelorette, we'll get to know them, we'll banter, and we'll send them on dates.
V: and then what?
L: And then we'll listen in on the dates, we'll make comments, we'll feel better about our own dating lives...
V: and who knows, maybe they'll find love, L: or get their hearts broken
V: 
L: well... that's a good point, but so are you
V: No, I'm the matchmaker
